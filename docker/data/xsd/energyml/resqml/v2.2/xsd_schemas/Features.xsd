		<xs:documentation>This package contains the main classes used to define and exchange data for geologic and technical features in RESQML Other packages in RESQML also define features and may leverage classes in this Feature package; those other packages include:
	- Wells
	- Seismic
	- Streamlines
Features refer to something that has physical existence at some point during the exploration, development, production, or abandonment of a reservoir. For example: It can be a boundary, a rock volume, a basin area, but also extends to a drilled well, a drilling rig, an injected or produced fluid, or a 2D, 3D, or 4D seismic survey.
In RESQML, features are divided into these categories: geologic or technical. 
Geologic Feature. Objects that exist a priori, in the natural world, for example: the rock formations and how they are positioned with regard to each other; the fluids that are present before production; or the position of the geological intervals with respect to each. Some of these objects are static—such as geologic intervals---while others are dynamic—such as fluids: their properties, geometries, and quantities may change over time during the course of field production.
This concept of geologic feature is relative to the three following features: BoundaryFeature, RockVolumeFeature and Model feature

Technical Feature. Objects that exist by the action of humans. Examples include: wells and all they may contain, seismic surveys (surface, permanent water bottom), or injected fluid volumes. Because the decision to deploy such equipment is the result of studies or decisions by humans, technical features are usually not subject to the same kind of large changes in interpretation as geologic features. However, they are still subject to measurement error and other sources of uncertainty, and so still can be considered as subject to “interpretation”.</xs:documentation>

A RockVolumeFeature is a geological feature (which is the general concept that refers to the various categories of geological objects that exist in the natural world).
For example: the stratigraphic boundaries, the =geobody boundaries or the fluid boundaries that are present before production. To simplify the hierarchy of concepts, the geological feature is not represented in the RESQML design.</xs:documentation>

Some of these rock volumes are “static”, while others are “dynamic”. Reservoir fluids are dynamic because their properties, geometries, and quantities may change over time during the course of field production.
